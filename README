execute it.

Using static renderer:
======================

You need to type some commands (described below) to generate the static
pages of your blog. The the blog engine will automatically update them
when a comment is posted. To enable the static mode, just define
ENABLE_STATIC in the config.h file.

Permissions consideration: The HTML and XML files in the directory
BASE_DIR (in config.h) must be writable by the httpd user, to update them
when a comment is posted.

Chroot considerations: If you run your httpd server in a chroot, the
root directory won't be the same if the blog engine is started by the
httpd server or from the command line, so the templates and data files
won't be at the same place. To fix this just modify CHROOT_DIR (in
config.h).

To generate all the static pages, you have to type this command:
	env GEN_STATIC= ./blog

To update the static pages when you have written new articles
(NOT YET SUPPORTED):
	env UP_STATIC= ./blog

And to re-generate a specific article (which you have modified):
	env UP_STATIC="<name of the directory of the article>" ./blog
For example:
	env UP_STATIC="200811121418a" ./blog
If the article doesn't exist an empty page will be created.
