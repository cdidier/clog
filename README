Installation:
=============

Edit the file config.h to configure the blog engine before compiling it.

The to build it, just type (on *BSD):
	make
(on a Linux system, use pmake)

Disabling comments:
===================

You can disable comments (so you can't see and post them) by commenting
the line where ENABLE_COMMENTS is defined (in config.h).

Or simply disable the way to post comments (so you can see the comments
posted before and you can't post new comment anymore) by commenting
the line where ENABLE_POST_COMMENT is defined (in config.h).

Disabling GZIP compression:
===========================

If you don't want the GZIP compression, you can disable it by
commenting the line where ENABLE_GZIP is defined (in config.h).

Then you must remove "-lz" from the variable LDFLAGS in the Makefile.

Using static renderer:
======================

You need to type some commands (described below) to generate the static
pages of your blog. The the blog engine will automatically update them
when a comment is posted. To enable the static mode, just define
ENABLE_STATIC in the config.h file.

Permissions consideration: The HTML and XML files in the directory
BASE_DIR (in config.h) must be writable by the httpd user.

Chroot considerations: If you run your httpd server in a chroot, the
root directory won't be the same if the blog engine is started by the
httpd server or from the command line, so the templates and data files
won't be at the same place. To fix this just modify CHROOT_DIR (in
config.h).

To generate all the static pages, you have to type this command:
	env GEN_STATIC= ./blog.cgi

To update the static pages when you have written new articles:
        env UP_STATIC= ./blog.cgi

And to re-generate a specific article (which you have modified):
	env UP_STATIC="<name of the directory of the article>" ./blog.cgi
For example:
	env UP_STATIC="200811121418a" ./blog.cgi
